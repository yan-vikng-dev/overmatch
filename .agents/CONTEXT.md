# Overmatch

A realistic 3D multiplayer tank game (Bevy/Rust), single-player vertical slice in progress.
This file is the project glossary — terms only. Decisions live in `.agents/docs/adr/`.

## Aiming

**Sight** (reticle):
The camera's view direction, marked by the fixed dot at screen center. Where the player is *looking*.
_Avoid_: crosshair, cursor

**Aim point**:
The ground point the gun is *commanded* to hit, resolved from the camera's screen-center ray and stored in the hull's local frame. Intent — where we've told the gun to go, not where it actually points.
_Avoid_: target, aim target

**Bore axis**:
The line straight down the barrel (the muzzle's forward direction); shells depart along it.
_Avoid_: gun line, muzzle direction

**Bore point**:
Where the bore axis currently meets the ground; what the green bore indicator marks. The gun's *reality*, as opposed to the aim point's intent.
_Avoid_: bore aim point

**Target**:
A designated thing to engage (a locked-on or selected enemy). Reserved for future designation; not yet implemented. Never use it for the commanded ground point — that is the aim point.
_Avoid_: using "target" for the aim point

## Tank rig

**Rig contract**:
The set of named nodes the model must provide for code to bind behaviour to — the required markers (`Hull`, `Turret`, `Gun`, `Gun_Barrel`, `Muzzle`, `Center_Of_Mass`), at least one collision proxy, and at least one roadwheel per side. Absence is a fatal authoring error caught at bind, not a runtime condition.

**Hull**:
The tank body — the chassis the turret sits on, and the frame all aim math is computed relative to.

**Turret**:
The rotating top; yaws to bear on the aim point.

**Gun**:
The gun mount — the elevation pivot and the (stationary) mantlet. Elevates in pitch.
_Avoid_: barrel (that is a separate, recoiling node)

**Gun barrel**:
The recoiling barrel — child of the Gun, parent of the Muzzle. Slides under recoil while the Gun mount stays put.

**Muzzle**:
The barrel's tip. Its forward is the bore axis; shells spawn here.

## Gunnery

**Servo**:
A 1-DOF *kinematic* rotational motor with a trapezoidal motion profile, slewing turret yaw / gun pitch toward a commanded angle. Not a physics joint — we drive it ourselves.

**Recoil**:
The barrel's rearward kick on firing and its damped spring back to battery — a 1-DOF translational motor, the bore-axis cousin of the Servo.

**Battery**:
The barrel's rest (fully forward) position, to which recoil returns. "Return to battery."

**Stabilization**:
Keeping the gun's lay steady against hull motion. Three regimes, by what is held fixed:
- *Unstabilized* — the gun holds a hull-relative bearing and sweeps as the hull moves (WW2). Aim stored hull-local.
- *Directional stabilization* — the gun holds a fixed world *direction* (a ray: bearing + elevation), counter-rotating against hull motion but not tracking a point while driving (the modern two-plane stabilizer; fire-on-the-move). Aim stored as a world ray.
- *Point stabilization* — the gun holds a fixed world *point* (a position), re-laying as the hull rotates *and* translates so it tracks the spot through parallax (lock-on / FCS auto-tracker). Aim stored as a world point.
Today's default is unstabilized; the other two are deliberate later mechanics.
_Avoid_: "stab" (write it out)

## Driving

**Running gear**:
The whole ground-contact mechanism of one side — roadwheels, track, sprocket, idler.

**Roadwheel**:
A load-bearing wheel of the running gear; the wheels whose share of the tank's weight presses the track onto the ground.
_Avoid_: wheel (ambiguous with the sprocket / idler / return rollers, which carry no ground load)

**Sprocket / Idler**:
The drive sprocket (where engine torque enters the track) and the idler (track tensioner) at the ends of each side. They shape the track loop but bear no ground load.
_Avoid_: drive wheel

**Track**:
The continuous belt around the running gear. In the sim it is **cosmetic** — it carries no physics; locomotion is modelled at the roadwheels.
_Avoid_: tread, caterpillar

**Contact station**:
A longitudinal point where a roadwheel transfers load to the ground; the unit at which both suspension and track-against-ground friction are sampled.
_Avoid_: contact patch

**Effective radius**:
The hub-centre-to-ground distance — wheel radius plus track thickness — shared by the suspension and the visual track so they agree on where the ground is.
_Avoid_: wheel radius (that is only part of it)

**Ride height**:
The hull's resting height, set by where the loaded suspension settles each roadwheel above the ground.

**Suspension travel**:
A roadwheel's vertical range between full compression (bump) and full extension (droop).

**Differential thrust**:
Independent longitudinal force per track; steering arises from the left–right difference, not a separate turn input.

**Skid steer**:
Turning by differential thrust, resisted by the tracks shearing sideways against the ground.

**Neutral steer**:
Pivoting in place with the tracks counter-rotating — equal and opposite thrust giving a pure yaw couple and zero net travel.
_Avoid_: pivot turn, neutral turn

**Friction circle**:
The shared grip budget at a contact station — longitudinal and lateral force together capped at μ × normal load.
_Avoid_: friction ellipse

**Grip anchor**:
The world point a roadwheel's contact sticks to at rest; a brush spring pulls the contact back toward it (capped at the friction circle) to hold the tank statically. Planted when the contact slows past the stick speed, dropped when it breaks loose.
_Avoid_: contact patch (that is the contact station)

**Stick speed**:
The contact speed below which a roadwheel grips — plants a grip anchor and holds with static friction — and above which it slips into kinetic friction. The static↔kinetic gate.

**Hill-hold**:
The tank holding station on a slope under its own grip anchors with no throttle — emergent static friction up to μ × load. Past that the slope wins and it slides.
_Avoid_: handbrake (that is a separate, future input)

**Engine-brake / coast-down**:
The light longitudinal resistance applied when the throttle is released while the tank is still rolling — bleeds speed toward a stop before the grip anchors take over. The "heavy-glide" feel: how much momentum a released tank keeps.

## Collision

**Part layer**:
One of the parallel concerns a rig part carries: its visual mesh, its collision proxy, and its ballistic volumes (armor and modules alike — see Armor & penetration). Each is authored as child geometry/components of the part and queried independently, by type. The part is the unit; the layers compose on it.

**Collision proxy**:
A simplified convex shape standing in for a part's detailed mesh in the physics solver — authored on the model as a hidden collider mesh, never the render mesh. Coarse by design: only the outer convex envelope matters to collision.
_Avoid_: collision mesh (suggests the full visual mesh)

**Compound collider**:
Several convex proxies on one rigid body that together approximate a concave shape (e.g. the stepped hull front as 2–3 pieces). The only way to represent concavity for a dynamic body, which cannot use a single concave collider.

## Armor & penetration

(Model: `.agents/docs/design/armor-penetration-and-damage.md`.)

**Ballistic volume**:
A watertight solid mesh plus a material that taxes a penetrator over the line-of-sight distance through it — the single primitive both armor and modules are. Read by the penetration raycast, not the physics solver, so it need not be convex (but must be manifold).
_Avoid_: armor plate, module (those are roles layered on a ballistic volume, not the thing itself)

**Module**:
A ballistic volume that also carries a function and state (engine, ammunition, breech, optics, transmission). Loses capability when damaged; repairable (ammunition excepted). Crew are the other layered role.
_Avoid_: component (use it loosely in prose, but the rig term is module)

**Material factor**:
The per-volume multiplier turning line-of-sight distance into penetration cost — high for dense armor steel, low for an engine block. Density/hardness expressed as one number.

**Line-of-sight thickness**:
The geometric distance a penetrator travels through a ballistic volume, entry face to exit face. Slope is captured by this length, not by a separate cosine term.
_Avoid_: effective thickness (that is line-of-sight thickness × material factor — the cost)

**Penetration capability**:
The reference-millimetres of armor a shell can defeat at its *current* velocity — a derivative of velocity for a given shell, not a fixed stat.
_Avoid_: penetration value, pen (it changes shot-to-shot as velocity bleeds)

**Normalization**:
The penetrator's path bending toward the surface normal as it enters a volume, shortening its line-of-sight path.

**Ricochet**:
Deflection off a too-steep face without entering — spawns a new path segment and bleeds velocity, no penetration. Suppressed by overmatch.

**Overmatch**:
When a shell's caliber greatly exceeds a volume's thickness along its normal, suppressing ricochet and slope. The game's namesake, but one modifier among many — not the centre of the model.

**Spall** (exit cone):
The fixed-shape cone of fragments thrown from a volume's exit face on perforation — dense on-axis, thinning with angle and distance — and the primary crew-killer. Each fragment is one HP unit that stops at the first volume it reaches.
_Avoid_: spalling, fragmentation, frag (the noun is spall; the emitter is the exit cone)

**Crew station**:
A crew function — gunner (aim), loader (reload), driver (move), commander (view/command). Served by whichever living crewman holds it, and backfilled at degraded effectiveness by others, the commander being the universal backup.
_Avoid_: crew slot, seat

**Cookoff**:
Detonation of an ammunition volume when its HP is depleted — instantly kills all crew. The one terminal, non-repairable event.
_Avoid_: ammo rack explosion, detonation (reserve detonation for HE)

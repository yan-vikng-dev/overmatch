# Per-variant data in RON spec-sheet assets; skein deferred

Per-tank-variant tuning data — mass, angular-inertia extents, drivetrain characteristics, suspension, servo speeds/travel (and later caliber, reload) — lives in a **per-variant RON data asset** (`<variant>.tank.ron`), deserialized via `serde` straight into the components the sim reads (`Mass`, `AngularInertia`, `Drivetrain`, `SuspensionParams`, `ServoSpec`) and applied to the rig in `on_tank_ready` (the spec is a load dependency, ADR-0011). The Blender model keeps **geometry and spatial anchors** (the `Center_Of_Mass` Empty, the `*_Collider` proxies, future hardpoints — all native glTF, no addon); **structure** stays name-bound in code ([[0002-plugin-per-feature-architecture]]); only the flat per-variant *numbers* move out to RON. Notably, mass properties are authored, **not** derived from the abstract collision proxy ([[0011-required-model-contract-fails-fast]]). This **supersedes [[0007-model-authored-data-via-skein]]**.

Why RON, and why not the model itself:

- **The data isn't node-bound.** Skein's one real capability is binding *typed structs to specific model nodes* (so the datum and the node travel together). We have none of that: the drivetrain is one blob, and the two servos are non-spatial and already enumerated by name in code. Flat per-variant scalars gain nothing from living on a node — and lose a lot.
- **git-diffable / reviewable.** A `.glb` is binary; a thrust change embedded in it vanishes from PR review. A `.ron` file is plain text.
- **No DCC round-trip.** Editable without Blender open, hot-reloadable, no recompile. The live-tuning loop targets the *game* and can persist back to RON — a cleaner "game is the consumer" story than hand-editing the `.blend`.
- **No fast-moving dependency.** Skein is a Bevy plugin **plus** a Blender addon **plus** a BRP schema bridge, all version-coupled to a bleeding-edge Bevy/Avian stack. RON is `serde` + a ~25-line in-crate `AssetLoader`.

## Considered Options

- **skein (the superseded decision).** Typed components authored in Blender, carried in glTF extras via the registry/BRP. The right tool when **many node-bound typed structs** need spatial/visual authoring, or a non-coder content pipeline. **Deferred, not rejected forever**: re-adoptable when Phase-4 multi-variant work brings genuinely node-attached structs (per-plate armor angle+thickness, per-wheel suspension params, hardpoint modules). It was adopted in ADR-0007 but *no data ever flowed through it* — the dependency, plugin, and dev BRP server carried zero payload.
- **Native `GltfExtras` (hand-parsed).** Same "data embedded in the binary" downside as skein, without the typed-authoring upside. No.
- **`bevy_common_assets` `RonAssetPlugin`.** The standard RON-asset loader, but it has no crates.io release for Bevy 0.19 (git `main` only). A git dependency on a fast-moving crate is the very version-lag fragility we're avoiding; a tiny in-crate loader is more robust.
- **All-code consts (status quo).** Can't vary per variant, can't be tuned/reviewed separately from code, forces a recompile per change.

## Consequences

- **Dependencies:** `serde` + `ron` added (small, stable, non-engine); `bevy_skein` removed.
- **Components:** `Drivetrain`, `ServoSpec`, `Axis`, `Travel` derive `serde::Deserialize` (+ `Clone`); they are no longer `Reflect` / `register_type`'d. Re-adding reflection later (if skein returns) is cheap.
- **Spatial data stays on the model**, unchanged and skein-free: COM is an Empty's transform, colliders are mesh-derived ([[0008-collision-convex-proxies]]). This is the data class that genuinely belongs on the model — and native glTF already covers it.
- **No fallback to default stats.** This is a competitive PvP sim: a tank silently running on guessed stats is a fairness bug strictly worse than a crash, so per-variant data has **no code `Default`**. `Drivetrain` is simply absent until applied.
- **Load timing vs. failure.** The spec is a *load dependency* (ADR-0011): the tank is spawned only after its `.tank.ron` loads, so `on_tank_ready` binds the spec onto the rig in one pass — no spec-less window. A genuine load failure is **fatal** — it panics in every build (at spawn for the initial load, `report_failed_spec` for a bad hot-reload), since no acceptable degraded state exists. A schema-drift test (`include_str!` → deserialize) catches the same error class at `cargo test` time, before a bad file ever ships.
- **Units:** servo angles are authored in **degrees** in RON (the human unit); `drive_servos` converts to radians (unchanged from the servo split).
